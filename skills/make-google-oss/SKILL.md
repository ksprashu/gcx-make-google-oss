## Execution Plan

Execute the following steps sequentially. Do **NOT** abort the entire process if a single step fails, unless it's critical for *all* subsequent steps (like Step 1). Update the **Live Progress Tracker** as you go.

**1. Define Target Project:**
- Acknowledge the current working directory (`{{cwd}}`) as the target.
- Update Step 1 to ✅.

**2. Prepare Tools:**
- Update Step 2 to ⏳.
- Check if `addlicense` is installed (`which addlicense`).
- If NOT installed:
    - Check if Go is installed (`which go`).
    - If Go IS installed, ask the user: "`addlicense` is missing. Shall I install it using `go install github.com/google/addlicense@latest`?"
        - If yes, run the install command.
        - If no, mark Step 2 as ⚠️ (Warning: Tools missing), record this issue for the summary, and proceed.
    - If Go IS NOT installed, mark Step 2 as ❌ (Failed: Go required for auto-install), record this issue for the summary, and proceed.
- If `addlicense` is confirmed available, update Step 2 to ✅.

**3. Clone Reference Template:**
- Update Step 3 to ⏳.
- Create a temporary directory: `.gemini-tmp/`.
- Clone `https://github.com/google/new-project` into `.gemini-tmp/google-oss-template`.
- If cloning fails, mark Step 3 as ❌ and **ABORT** (cannot proceed without templates).
- Update Step 3 to ✅.

**4. Add Core Files:**
- Update Step 4 to ⏳.
- Copy `LICENSE`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, and `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` from `.gemini-tmp/google-oss-template/` to the project root.
- **Crucial:** Do NOT overwrite existing files without asking the user first.
- Update Step 4 to ✅.

**5. Scrub Check (Internal Artifacts):**
- Update Step 5 to ⏳.
- Run: `grep -rE "@google.com|corp.google.com|borg|monarch" . --exclude-dir={.git,.gemini-tmp,node_modules,vendor,build,dist}`
- If matches found, display them, mark Step 5 as ⚠️ (Manual review needed), and record these matches for the final summary.
- If no matches, update Step 5 to ✅.

**6. Apply Source Code License Headers:**
- Update Step 6 to ⏳.
- If Step 2 was NOT ✅ (tools missing), mark Step 6 as ⚠️ (Skipped: `addlicense` missing), record this for the summary, and proceed.
- If tools are available, run: `addlicense -c "Google LLC" -l apache -ignore ".gemini-tmp/**" .`
- If `addlicense` fails, mark Step 6 as ❌ and record the error for the summary.
- Otherwise, update Step 6 to ✅.

**7. Update README.md:**
- Update Step 7 to ⏳.
- Read or create `README.md`.
- Ensure it contains these exact sections (append if missing):
    ```markdown
    ## Disclaimer

    This is not an officially supported Google product.

    ## License

    This project is licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0. See the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file for details.
    ```
- Update Step 7 to ✅.

**8. Clean Up:**
- Update Step 8 to ⏳.
- Remove the `.gemini-tmp/` directory.
- Update Step 8 to ✅.

**9. Finalize:**
- Update Step 9 to ⏳.
- Run `git status` to show changes.
- **CRITICAL:** If ANY warnings (⚠️) or failures (❌) were recorded, print a "⚠️ Summary of Issues" section here, listing them all clearly so the user doesn't have to scroll up.
- Ask: "Would you like me to commit the successful changes with the message 'chore: apply Google OSS compliance standards'?"
- If yes, stage and commit.
- Update Step 9 to ✅.
- Update **Overall Status** to ✅ (if all perfect), ⚠️ (if warnings), or ❌ (if critical failures) and print final log.
